# Pose-Detection-for-Camera

It's not always possible to hire a professional to click pictures. 
Sometimes, we want to upload a random picture or a selfie on our Instagram.
 Now you can click good pictures on your own.
Yes, now you can click pictures of human subjects with the help of the pose detection technique.
The pose detection model is a simple image classification technique That is trained upon thousands of images and can predict the best and worst pose for your photograph in real-time.
With pose detection, the only thing you need to do is to open your camera app and start clicking pictures.

We can integrate this technology into our stock cameras, DSLRs
Or we can create our camera app.

Here I provide you the pre-trained model file. All you need to do is to load the model and run the code.
